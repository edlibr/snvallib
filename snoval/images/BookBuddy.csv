Design Patterns,,Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software,,,"Erich Gamma,John Vlissides,Ralph Johnson,Richard Helm","Gamma, Erich",,,,,,Pearson Education,,1994/10/30,1994,,,,Computers,"Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.",,,,,,,,,,,457,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780321700698,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,6oHuKQe3TjQC,Professional,0,0,0,,,

Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design,,A Brain Friendly Guide to OOA&D,,,"Brett McLaughlin,David West,Gary Pollice","McLaughlin, Brett",,,,,,"O'Reilly Media, Inc.",,2006/11/26,2006,,,,Computers,"""Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design is a refreshing look at subject of OOAD. What sets this book apart is its focus on learning. The authors have made the content of OOAD accessible, usable for the practitioner.""  Ivar Jacobson, Ivar Jacobson Consulting  ""I just finished reading HF OOA&D and I loved it! The thing I liked most about this book was its focus on why we do OOA&D-to write great software!""  Kyle Brown, Distinguished Engineer, IBM  ""Hidden behind the funny pictures and crazy fonts is a serious, intelligent, extremely well-crafted presentation of OO Analysis and Design. As I read the book, I felt like I was looking over the shoulder of an expert designer who was explaining to me what issues were important at each step, and why.""  Edward Sciore, Associate Professor, Computer Science Department, Boston College   Tired of reading Object Oriented Analysis and Design books that only makes sense after you're an expert? You've heard OOA&D can help you write great software every time-software that makes your boss happy, your customers satisfied and gives you more time to do what makes you happy.  But how?  Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design shows you how to analyze, design, and write serious object-oriented software: software that's easy to reuse, maintain, and extend; software that doesn't hurt your head; software that lets you add new features without breaking the old ones. Inside you will learn how to:  Use OO principles like encapsulation and delegation to build applications that are flexible Apply the Open-Closed Principle (OCP) and the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to promote reuse of your code Leverage the power of design patterns to solve your problems more efficiently Use UML, use cases, and diagrams to ensure that all stakeholders are communicating clearly to help you deliver the right software that meets everyone's needs.   By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design compresses the time it takes to learn and retain complex information. Expect to have fun, expect to learn, expect to be writing great software consistently by the time you're finished reading this!",,,,,,,,,,,600,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780596008673,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,0,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,-QpmamSKl_EC,Professional,0,0,0,,,
The Code Book: The Secret History of Codes and Code-breaking,,The Secret History of Codes and Code-breaking,,,Simon Singh,"Singh, Simon",,,,,,HarperCollins Publishers,,2010/06/23,2010,,,,Science,"The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography From the best-selling author of Fermat’s Last Theorem, The Code Book is a history of man’s urge to uncover the secrets of codes, from Egyptian puzzles to modern day computer encryptions. As in Fermat’s Last Theorem, Simon Singh brings life to an anstonishing story of puzzles, codes, languages and riddles that reveals man’s continual pursuit to disguise and uncover, and to work out the secret languages of others. Codes have influenced events throughout history, both in the stories of those who make them and those who break them. The betrayal of Mary Queen of Scots and the cracking of the enigma code that helped the Allies in World War II are major episodes in a continuing history of cryptography. In addition to stories of intrigue and warfare, Simon Singh also investigates other codes, the unravelling of genes and the rediscovery of ancient languages and most tantalisingly, the Beale ciphers, an unbroken code that could hold the key to a $20 million treasure. Note that it has not been possible to include the same picture content that appeared in the original print version.",,,,,,,,,,,416,,,,,,English,,,,,,9780007378302,,0,0.000000,,Unread,,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,MPntmEiwjTkC,Personal,0,,,,,
